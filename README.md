# variational-median
The code is for the implementation of paper Robust and Scalable Variational Bayes.  
## Mutivariate Gaussian
coverage_of_vb_median_gmm.py is for the Gaussian example.  
## Gaussian mixture and real data 
Inside the code file we have the r code for posterior predictive density for Gaussian mixture. data_save.R is to save the r code to run the median. And median_gmm.ipynb is for the median. For the penguin data realdata_load.R is used. vb_gaussian_mix.R, vb_median.R, vb_median_data.R are to create and save the data.  
## Latent Dirichelet allocation
The lda.stan, exp.R and func.R is for the lda example.
